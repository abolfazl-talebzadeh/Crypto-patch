Your program should display the following information:
• the cyclic group and public parameters you use;
    - the public keys of Alice and Bob;
    - the key Kab shared by Alice and Bob;
    - the secret key K that will be used for encryption and decryption;
  the parameters and keys should be in the form of either decimal or hexadecimal;
• take input from Alice for encryption, the format for encryption can be binary/character
  string, fles, etc,
• take input from Bob for decryption, the format for decryption can be binary/text file;
• show Bob can decrypt Alice's encrypted file as expected
  namely, show Dec(Enc(INa,K),K) = INA, where INA represents Alice's input file;
• have some kind of user interface, but not necessary GUI;
